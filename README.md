# Introduction

`hmp4` is short for `HMPPPP` --- a tool intended to allow for the configuration
of HMPP codelet generation preprocessor directives through the use of
higher-order preprocessor directives. This tool makes it easy to change the loop
configuration parameters in your HMPP kernels without manually changing the
preprocessor directives in your code.
